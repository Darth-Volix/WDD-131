			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To build a review website that shows off my current skills with web developement and my thoughts on food and other products. 
				I also want to use this website to attract potential employers and show off my personality.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>There is actually a wide audience I hope to have with this website. Prospective Employers, Family, Friends, and anyone else 
				interested in my take on food and other topics.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The reviews will be held in a JavaScript array. There will be a function that chooses three at random
				when the page loads and modifies the HTML to display them. There will be a search bar that is built in 
			    With a JavaScript function listening to it. The function will search the JavaScript array for matches
			    and modify the HTML to disply the results. There will be another JavaScript function that modifies
			    the number of stars displayed to the screen via the HTML structure based on the star rating provided 
			    in the JavaScript array. I will add other JavaScript functionality as needed, such as if I need it to
			    properly handle screen resizing.

			<h5>About Me</h5>
			<p>
			  Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Nicholas Wilkins and I am the creator and administrator of this website. I was born and raised in South Jordan, Utah as the 3rd of 8 children. I married the love of my life in the summer of 2021 and we are currently going through the opening stage of parenthood with our 1-month old son, Archer. I have worked in the financial industry for the last four years, but I am currently working on transitioning my skillset to a new industry - software engineering. Growing up, food was a big part of my life. My family would always gather around the dinner table to share a meal and talk about our day. I have always loved trying new foods and experimenting with different flavors. I think you could safely say that food is a love language for myself and my family. Outside of work, I enjoy a good book, baseball, football, Star Wars, spending time with my family, and the occasional video game.
			</p>
			<h5>Goal of This Website</h5>
			<p>
			  The goal of this website is to showcase my skills in web development and design while also sharing my thoughts and opinions on various topics, with a particular focus on food reviews. I want to create a platform where I can express myself creatively, connect with others who share similar interests (hit the links to connect on Social Media), and potentially attract future employers. By combining my passion for food with my technical skills, I hope to create a unique and engaging experience for visitors to the site. Whether you're looking for honest reviews, interesting insights, or just a glimpse into my personality, I aim to provide content that is informative, entertaining, and relatable. Welcome to Volix Reviews – where food meets technology!

				<p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)</p>
				<p><strong>Tags:</strong> Mexican, TacoBell</p>
				<p><strong>Crunchwrap Supreme:</strong> The Crunchwrap Supreme is a testament to Taco Bell's innovative approach to fast food. Encased in a grilled flour tortilla, the layers of seasoned beef, nacho cheese sauce, crunchy tostada shell, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream deliver a symphony of flavors and textures. It's a portable, all-in-one meal that's both filling and flavorful, perfect for on-the-go indulgence.</p>

				<p><strong>Tags:</strong> Mexican, TacoBell</p>
				<p><strong>Cheesy Gordita Crunch:</strong> The Cheesy Gordita Crunch is a delightful fusion of textures and flavors that keeps you coming back for more. The warm, soft flatbread wrapped around a crunchy taco shell, stuffed with seasoned beef, crisp lettuce, and tangy cheddar cheese, creates a perfect balance of soft and crunchy. The spicy ranch sauce adds a creamy, zesty kick that ties all the elements together, making each bite a satisfying experience.</p>

				<p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)</p>
				<p><strong>Tags:</strong> JerseyMikes, Subs, HotSandwhich</p>
				<p><strong>Big Kahuna:</strong> The Big Kahuna at Jersey Mike's is a hearty and satisfying sub that leaves a lasting impression. Packed with grilled steak, sizzling onions, peppers, mushrooms, and jalapeños, all smothered in melty American cheese, this sandwich is a flavor powerhouse. Each bite offers a perfect blend of savory, spicy, and cheesy goodness, making it a top choice for those craving a substantial and delicious meal. Whether you're a fan of hot subs or just looking for something filling and flavorful, the Big Kahuna does not disappoint.</p>

				<p><strong>Date:</strong> July 5, 2024</p>
				<p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)</p>
				<p><strong>Tags:</strong> JimmyJohns, Subs, ColdSandwhich</p>
				<p><strong>Vito:</strong> The Vito at Jimmy John's is somewhat underwhelming for an Italian sub. While the ingredients – salami, capicola, provolone, onion, lettuce, tomato, and a drizzle of vinaigrette – sound promising, the flavors don’t quite come together as expected. The bread, although fresh, tends to overpower the fillings, leaving the sandwich tasting more like a roll with a hint of meat and cheese. Additionally, the vinaigrette can be overly acidic, detracting from the overall experience. It's an average sub that lacks the bold flavors one might hope for in an Italian sandwich.</p>

				<p><strong>Date:</strong> July 5, 2024</p>
				<p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)</p>
				<p><strong>Tags:</strong> Wendys, ChickenSandwich, American</p>
				<p><strong>Spicy Asiago Ranch Chicken Club:</strong> The Spicy Asiago Ranch Chicken Club at Wendy's is a flavorful and satisfying choice for those who enjoy a bit of heat in their meals. The crispy chicken fillet is perfectly spiced and pairs well with the fresh lettuce, tomato, and creamy Asiago cheese. The sandwich is topped with a savory ranch sauce that adds a nice tangy contrast. However, the bacon, while generally a favorite, feels a bit out of place and can be omitted for an even better experience. Overall, it's a delicious option that balances spice and flavor beautifully.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p><strong>Date:</strong> July 5, 2024</p>
				<p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐☆☆☆☆ (1/5)</p>
				<p><strong>Tags:</strong> McDonalds, Burgers, American</p>
				<p><strong>Big Mac:</strong> The Big Mac at McDonald's is a classic that unfortunately falls short in almost every aspect. Beyond the iconic sesame seed bun, everything else feels and tastes artificial. The patties are often dry and lack any real beef flavor, and the special sauce has become overly sweet and synthetic. The lettuce is typically wilted, and the pickles lack crunch and freshness. Even the cheese has a processed taste that doesn't melt well. Overall, the Big Mac disappoints with its artificial ingredients and lackluster execution, making it a relic that hasn't aged well.</p>
