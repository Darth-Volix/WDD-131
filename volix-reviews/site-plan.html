			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>To build a review website that shows off my current skills with web developement and my thoughts on food and other products. 
				I also want to use this website to attract potential employers and show off my personality.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>There is actually a wide audience I hope to have with this website. Prospective Employers, Family, Friends, and anyone else 
				interested in my take on food and other topics.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The reviews will be held in a JavaScript array. There will be a function that chooses one at random
				when the page loads and modifies the HTML to display it. There will be a search bar that is built in 
			    With a JavaScript function listening to it. The function will search the JavaScript array for matches
			    and modify the HTML to disply the results. There will be another JavaScript function that modifies
			    the number of stars displayed to the screen via the HTML structure based on the star rating provided 
			    in the JavaScript array. I will add other JavaScript functionality as needed, such as if I need it to
			    properly handle screen resizing.

			<h5>About Me</h5>
			<p>
			  Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nicholas Wilkins and I am the creator and administrator of this website. I was born and raised in South Jordan, Utah as the 3rd of 8 children. I married the love of my life in the summer of 2021 and we are currently going through the opening stage of parenthood with our 1-month old son, Archer. I have worked in the financial industry for the last four years, but I am currently working on transitioning my skillset to a new industry - software engineering.  I currently have experience in web development with HTML/CSS and Javascript, programming with Python and C#, and database design and management with mySQL. Outside of work and school I am a passionate 49ers fan, Yankees fan, Swfitie, and enjoy the occasional video game.  
			</p>
			<h5>Goal of This Website</h5>
			<p>
			  The goal of this website is to build a personal review website that showcases my skills and personality in my reviews, and that attracts the attention of potential employers. I also want to use this website to demonstrate my proficiency and attention to detail in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I also want to use this website to display my flexibility and creativity with design. This website will be updated and expanded as needed while I continue to grow, learn, and develop skills within the industry and at school. It will also be updated as I continue to review new food items and other products.
