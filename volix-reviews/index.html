                                Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Nicholas Wilkins and I am the creator and administrator of this website. I was born and raised in South Jordan, Utah as the 3rd of 8 children. I married the love of my life in the summer of 2021 and we are currently going through the opening stage of parenthood with our 1-month old son, Archer. I have worked in the financial industry for the last four years, but I am currently working on transitioning my skillset to a new industry - software engineering. Growing up, food was a big part of my life. My family would always gather around the dinner table to share a meal and talk about our day. I have always loved trying new foods and experimenting with different flavors. I think you could safely say that food is a love language for myself and my family. Outside of work, I enjoy a good book, baseball, football, Star Wars, spending time with my family, and the occasional video game.

                            The goal of this website is to showcase my skills in web development and design while also sharing my thoughts and opinions on various topics, with a particular focus on food reviews. I want to create a platform where I can express myself creatively, connect with others who share similar interests (hit the links to connect on Social Media), and potentially attract future employers. By combining my passion for food with my technical skills, I hope to create a unique and engaging experience for visitors to the site. Whether you're looking for honest reviews, interesting insights, or just a glimpse into my personality, I aim to provide content that is informative, entertaining, and relatable. Welcome to Volix Reviews â€“ where food meets technology!
